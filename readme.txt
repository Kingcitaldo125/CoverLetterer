A cover letter writer for anyone applying to jobs.
Uses some generic cover letter templates that I was able to unearth on the internet.

Follow the prompts when you go to make your cover letter, and please only type the requirements part as is!!
This helps to ensure that the grammar is as neat and clean as it can be, but it would be wise to proofread the cover letter anyways.

Thanks, and enjoy,
