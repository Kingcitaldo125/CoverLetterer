Dear Hiring Manager:
 I'm writing to express my interest in the recently advertised Software Engineer role.
 I believe I could bring valuable skills and experience to DCS that would make me an ideal fit for this position.
 I have almost 2 years of experience as a software developer, and in this time I have helped deploy applications in C++,
 wrote a web applet in Javascript, helped improve a backend database system using PostgreSQL and C++, and much more.
 I believe that I am an ample fit for the Software Engineer position here at DCS , because I have closely worked with
 languages such as C, C++, Java, Javascript, and Python in the past.
 I am a hard worker with a passion for software development. I believe that I can be a strong asset to DCS because of my strong knowledge in the languages described.
 Thank you for taking the time to consider my application, and I look forward to hearing from you.
 Yours sincerely,
 Paul Arelt.
