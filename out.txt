Dear Mr/Ms Manager:
 I'm writing to express my interest in the recently advertised Programmer role.
 I believe I could bring valuable skills and experience to CACI that would make me an ideal fit for this position.
 I have almost 2 years of experience as a software developer, and in this time I have helped deploy applications in C++,
  wrote a web applet in Javascript, helped improve a backend database system using PostgreSQL and C++, and much more.
 I believe that I am an ample fit for the Programmer position here at CACI , because I have closely worked with
 languages such as C, C++, Java, Javascript, Python, HTML and CSS in the past.
 I am a hard worker with a passion for coding. I believe that I can be a strong asset to CACI because of my strong knowledge in the languages described .
 Thank you for taking the time to consider my application, and I look forward to hearing from you.
 Yours sincerely,
 Paul Arelt.
