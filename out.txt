Dear Andrea Noonan:
 I'm writing to express my interest in the recently advertised Jr Application Developer role.
 I believe I could bring valuable skills and experience to Aero Fulfillment Services that would make me an ideal fit for this position.
 I have 4 years of experience as a game programmer, and in this time I have helped to build a game engine, made multiple 2D games,
 wrote code for an Operating System kernel, wrote a transducer, made multiple web pages and much more.
 I believe that I am an ample fit for the Jr Application Developer position here at Aero Fulfillment Services, because I have closely worked with
 languages such as C, C++, Java, Javascript, Python, HTML and CSS in the past.
 I am a hard worker with a passion for coding.
 I believe that I can be a strong asset to Aero Fulfillment Services because of my strong knowledge in the languages described.
 Thank you for taking the time to consider my application, and I look forward to hearing from you.
 Yours sincerely,
 Paul Arelt.
